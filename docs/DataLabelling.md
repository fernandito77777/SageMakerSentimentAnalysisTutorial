## Data Labelling using SageMaker Ground Truth

SageMaker Ground Truth is a segment on SageMaker, ML Platform on AWS that helps to label the data you would like to process on Machine Learning. For more description, please click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms.html)

Now, we are going to use it to label the data. We are going to use 2 dataset, 1 is for labelling process, and other 1 is for the labelled dataset.

1. Please download this [Indonesian Tweet dataset](../files/SentimentAnalysis-IndonesiaData.zip). Unzip it once you are done.
2. Alternatively, if you can't unzip files, here is the [data for label](../files/IndonesianTweetUnlabelled.csv) and [data for ML Process](../files/IndonesianTweetlabeled.csv)
